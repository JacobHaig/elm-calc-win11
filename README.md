# elm-calc-win11
 A recreation of the Windows 11 calculator in ELM

 This calculator is NOT for use! It is just a side project for designing UIs. The idea is the make a semi working replica of the windows 11 calculator. There are a number of issues that need be addressed before anyone should even try to use it as a calculator. Fix the javascript engine floating point precision. Implement a real parser. Replace the current string based stack. Finish adding the other functions. Probably a lot more!

 But as of right now, it works ok for simple operations. Basic Add, Subtract, Multiple, Divide all work. Some functions have been added as well. For instance, the squaring number button and flip sign button. There are other basic features that somewhat mimic how the windows 10 calculator works.
